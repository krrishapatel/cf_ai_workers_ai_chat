AI prompts used during development

Below are representative prompts used with an AI assistant to accelerate implementation. These prompts reflect high-level intent and do not copy code from other submissions. All implementation is original.

1) Project scaffolding
"Help me scaffold a Cloudflare Workers AI chat app using Workers AI (Llama 3.3), a Durable Object for conversation memory, and a minimal Pages UI. Provide file structure and wrangler.toml bindings."

2) Worker and DO API design
"Design a Worker endpoint POST /api/chat that reads {sessionId,message}, appends to a Durable Object, invokes Workers AI with accumulated messages, stores assistant reply, and returns the updated transcript."

3) Error handling and CORS
"Suggest minimal CORS headers and error handling patterns for a Workers API consumed by a static Pages UI."

4) UI behavior
"Create a simple HTML page with a fixed footer input, rendering chat bubbles for user/assistant using fetch('/api/chat')."
